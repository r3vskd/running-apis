## APIs
 An API is an intermediate software agent that allows dependent applications to communicate with each other. APIs provide a set of protocols, 
 routines, and developer tools enabling software developers to extract and share information and let applications interact in an accessible manner.

 Be it web APIs that connect web applications to other platforms or APIs used by IoT devices to collect and process data, the use of APIs has expanded like never before.

## Types of web-based APIs
 
 ### REST-based APIs
REST (Representational State Transfer) is one of the most lucrative categories of web-based APIs. Based on Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and HTTP protocol, REST-based APIs use JSON for data formatting which is considered to be browser-compatible.

 ### SOAP-based APIs
SOAP-based APIs (Simple Object Access Protocol) use a type of protocol known as Simple Object Access Protocol, which is a common communication protocol. This helps them in providing higher levels of security and makes them better at accuracy as compared with the REST-based APIs.

 ### GraphQL-based APIs
one of the most advanced sets of web-based APIs where open-source data query and manipulation language is used. This makes it easier for forming a definitive pathway for the runtime that plays a vital role in fulfilling queries with the pre-existing data.

 ### XML-RPC
XML-RPC (Extensible Markup Language-Remote Procedure Call)
Differentiates itself in terms of information security and the use of XML format that is specifically designed for transferring data. When compared to SOAP-based APIs, the XML-RPC protocols are easier and much simpler to use since they use minimum bandwidth.

 ### WebSocket
A two-way interactive communication session between the user’s browser and a server can be made smoother and faster with the help of an organized set of APIs known as WebSockets.
The entire process involving this doesn’t even require having to poll the server in order to receive a reply.
